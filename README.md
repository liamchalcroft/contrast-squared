This repository contains the official implementation of "Unified 3D MRI Representations via Sequence-Invariant Contrastive Learning" (**SeqInv**). Our method learns robust, sequence-agnostic representations from multi-site, multi-sequence MRI data using self-supervised learning, enabling improved performance on downstream tasks like segmentation and denoising.
