This repository contains the official implementation of "Sequence-Invariant Self-Supervised Learning for Robust Representations in 3D Medical Imaging". Our method learns robust, sequence-agnostic representations from multi-site, multi-sequence MRI data using self-supervised learning, enabling improved performance on downstream tasks like segmentation and denoising.
